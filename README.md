## Motivation

For many employees who come to their employee parking lot, searching for parking has become a difficult task as unauthorized people park there. 

To solve this problem, we decided to develop a system of smart gate called "Smart Gate" which will open the barrier automatically only to authorized people
by using face recognition and license plate recognition algorithms.

This system saves on security costs because the guard can monitor multiple parking lots simultaneously using an app that allows him to track in real-time who enters the parking lot and easily handle cases where the system fails to identify the employee.
